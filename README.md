### Airbnb-reservation System
airbnb-reservation System is an open-source educational project designed to teach learners how to manage and structure databases using a realistic and practical use case: a vacation rental and booking platform, inspired by Airbnb

The system simulates the core functions of an Airbnb-like managing properties (listings), hosts, guests, reservations, and reviews. Through this project, learners will gain hands-on experience in relational database design, data normalization, and writing SQL queries to support typical operations such as searching for listings, making reservations, and leaving reviews.

#### Objective
This challenge is designed to help learners understand and implement database design principles, including:
1. Structuring tables for efficient data management.
2. Implementing relationships between entities such as hosts, guests, properties, bookings, and reviews
3. Normalizing data to avoid redundancy and improve data integrity.
4. Writing SQL queries to support real-world use cases (e.g., searching listings by date/location, making a booking, viewing reservation history)

Through this project, learners will build elemental knowledge in database management, preparing them for more advanced topics in software development and database administration.
